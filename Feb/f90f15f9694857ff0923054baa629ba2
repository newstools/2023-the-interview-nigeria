Voting ended peacefully amid tight security on Saturday at Senator Bola Tinubuâ€™s Polling Unit in Lagos State. Tinubu, the All Progressive Congress Presidential Candidate, voted at Polling Unit 085, Ward C, Alausa, Ikeja. The tight security witnessed when he voted along with his wife, Olufemi, at 10.15 a.m., was sustained until the end of the election process. A combined team of the police, Nigeria Security Civil Defence Corps and Nigeria Immigration Service,  kept tight security at the unit even after Tinubu and his wife left. Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had visited the polling unit at 9.13 a.m. before arrival of INEC personnel and election materials. INEC personnel  began cancellation of unused ballot papers by 2:30 p.m. They later sorted and counted ballots before announcing results. Although the INEC personnel and materials arrived late at the polling unit (by 9:27 a.m.) they were idle after sometime, expecting more voters. (NAN)
