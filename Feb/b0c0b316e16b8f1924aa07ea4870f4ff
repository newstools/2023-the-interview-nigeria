Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State, on Wednesday met with the leadership of the state’s chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), following the incessant fuel scarcity in the state. Shortly after the meeting in Katsina, the governor told journalists that the meeting was an effort to find a lasting solution for the lingering fuel scarcity in the state. “Discussed with them, they told us part of their problem is that NNPC has said they should collect from Lagos at N172 and N174 per litre. “But fuel is not available in Lagos, so they had to resort to buying from independent importers. And independent importers are selling in the depot between N300 to N310. “And if somebody transports that product from Lagos to Katsina, at least each liter may attract N10 to N20 of transportation, assuming everything goes well. And they know the state of our roads as well. “I think this is an issue which we have reported to the NNPC, and now we have gotten the list of all allocations meant for Katsina State,” the governor said. Governor Masari said for all the independent marketers that have problems, “I am writing to the concerned department to address some of the problems, and those who have paid for a long time to give them the product. “Also, we have independent marketers that have not registered with the NNPC because of the cumbersome nature of the registration. “We as a government are going to assist them to make sure that they are registered,” Gov. Masari pledged. (NAN)
