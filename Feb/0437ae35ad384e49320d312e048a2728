Mrs. Aisha Abubakar,  Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) in charge of the 2023 elections in the  Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has assured residents of adequate security during Saturday`s election. Abubakar said this on Friday in Abuja, while addressing newsmen on the deployment of police personnel ahead of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections in the territory. She said the responsibility of police officers and other security agencies deployed for the election, was to ensure that the electoral process was safe, secured and credible. Abubakar cautioned security personnel deployed for the exercise against partisanship. “Our responsibility as police officers is to protect lives and property and create an environment where citizens can go about and exercise their franchise without fear of intimidation. “We are not politicians, but our duty is to ensure that all Nigerians and those contesting are protected and safe to cast their votes. “We should also be mindful of the vulnerable people among the electorate, women, the older persons and those living with disability,” she said. She urged the officers to be guided by relevant laws, guidelines and regulations for election duties to ensure that human rights are not abused while discharging their responsibilities. (NAN)
