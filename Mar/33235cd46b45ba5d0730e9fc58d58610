The Zamfara government has disbursed N70 million to empower 300 Point-of-Sale (PoS) operators to fast track implementation of the cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The Commissioner for Commerce and Industries, Alhaji Yazeed Danfulani stated this while distributing PoS machines to 300 youth and women on Wednesday in Gusau. He said the gesture was part of Governor Bello Matawalle’s empowerment and wealth creation programme, adding the PoS business would boost the cashless policy and make beneficiaries self-reliant. ”Each of the beneficiaries will receive a PoS machine, mobile shop, set of plastic chairs and tables to attend to customers. ”Each beneficiary will equally receive N50,000 seed capital to start the PoS transaction,” he said, adding that about N70 million has been earmarked for the programme. According to him, the PoS business will boost the state economy and revenue base as well as enhance wealth creation in the society. He said the government had set up a monitoring mechanism to ensure prudent use of the machines and other items given to the beneficiaries. The Commissioner urged the beneficiaries to ensure effective utilisation of the items and set up their businesses to enable them to become self-reliant. (NAN)
