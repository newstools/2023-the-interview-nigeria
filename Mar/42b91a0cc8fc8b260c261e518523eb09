Senator Kabir Marafa has urged the people of Zamfara to vote for Gov. Bello Matawalle for second term on Saturday in the Governorship election. Marafa made the call during a townhall meeting with loyalists across Zamfara Central in Gusau on Monday. ”Victory for the All Progressives Party (APC) at the state level is very critical so that the President-elect will have more governors to rally round him. ”A vote for Matawalle will also ensure a successful implementation of developmental policies and programmes already designed for the country. ”Victory for the APC at the national level is a blessing to the country and Zamfara state should not be left out,” he said. He therefore, called on party supporters in the state to take the golden opportunity by re-electing APC in the assembly elections on Saturday. (NAN)
